I'm a systems analyst based in Bol√≠var, a beautiful small city
in Buenos Aires - Argentina. I specialise in help teams and
clients to build products from the ground up. In 13+ years of
freelancing career I hard-earned experience working with low
budgets, building infraestructure, DevOps, coding back and
frontend and also dealing with clients and end users.

But not everything in me is about job: I'm a minimalist at
heart, open source lover and bad harmonica player. I enjoy
cooking for my family and friends, being italian pastas my
forte. Avid reader and with a very ecletic taste in music: from classical music to
K/J-Pop and everything in between. Nature conscious: I don't own
a car and prefer walk / cycling, avoid plastics everytime I can.
